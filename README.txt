# 1) I completed steps 1-6 to the best of my capability, was having power issues as well as flooding issues this past week but I don't know if I could have done any better, sorry.
# 2) These steps are verfiable to a certain extent with commenting and uncommenting certain sections of the kernel.c (Some steps were combined however), and there are some compiling issues sadly.
